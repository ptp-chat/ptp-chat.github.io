    <h3>An open letter to previous members of PTP and guests.</h3>
    <p>
      As many of you have noticed, PTP's discord no longer exists and you were
      told to move to the continously growing Programmers server. I made this
      decision because I felt that PTP was not growing or becoming better
      it continued to remain a closely knit group with hardly any collaboration
      or programming related discussion. In fact a majority of the conversation
      was very general and or completely unrelated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created PTP to provide a community where developers could come and talk
      to other developers, meet, collaborate and discuss. The way PTP was operating
      was contrary to that and I felt that it would be best to move everyone to an
      environment where they could actually achieve this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking towards the future I see a much better outcome for the previous
      members of PTP. The Programmers server provides an environment where you
      are exposed to developers with more experience, you can create more
      connections and friends, and most importantly it is an active community.
    </p>
    <p>
      I apologize for the connections that you have lost or for those of you
      who were considering joining, the connections that you may of lost. However
      I felt this was a needed move and I regret nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you,
      Sean Wilson.
